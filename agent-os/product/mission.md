# Product Mission

## Pitch
Mirror Array is a playful light-lab kit that helps tech geeks sketch and remix reflection patterns by giving them precise mirror control and quick feedback in a small, hackable package.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- Makers and hardware hackers: Experiment with motor-driven mirrors to build one-off light shows and weekend demos.
- Creative coding crews: Prototype interactive light walls that respond to code, sensors, or live inputs.

### User Personas
**Garage Light Hacker** (25-38)
- **Role:** Nights-and-weekends tinkerer who loves steppers, lasers, and flashy demos.
- **Context:** Works in a cramped workshop with DIY rigs and a rotating cast of friends dropping in.
- **Pain Points:** Manual mirror tweaks, hard-to-repeat light moves, and no easy way to share setups.
- **Goals:** Spin up reliable mirror choreographies fast enough to show off at the next meetup.

**Creative Coding Duo** (28-45)
- **Role:** Small team that blends projection, sensors, and code-driven visuals.
- **Context:** Tours pop-up experiences, juggling budget gear and tight setup windows.
- **Pain Points:** Fragile mirror rigs, time-consuming calibration, and few chances to test before going live.
- **Goals:** Load repeatable reflection patterns and riff on them with code or audience input.

**Weekend Pattern Tinkerer** (20-40)
- **Role:** Solo experimenter who spends rainy afternoons scripting motion sequences.
- **Context:** Hops between open-source tools and quick breadboard hacks in a tiny apartment lab.
- **Pain Points:** Hard-to-adjust mounts, minimal motion ranges, and no easy way to preview custom sequences.
- **Goals:** Snap together a rig, try wild motion scripts, and share the best ones without building new hardware.

**Installation Superfan** (All ages)
- **Role:** Visitor or passerby who loves watching kinetic light shows.
- **Context:** Encounters pop-up installations in galleries, plazas, or meetups.
- **Pain Points:** Static displays that burn out quickly and don’t react to the crowd.
- **Goals:** Get mesmerized by evolving reflections and see new patterns every time they drop in.

## The Problem

### DIY Mirror Chaos
Most hacker-grade mirror projects need hours of fiddly alignment and still drift off target the moment someone nudges the rig.

**Our Solution:** Snap together a modular mirror deck with repeatable motion cues so experiments stay on track even after a road trip.

## Differentiators

### Hackable Paths To Scale
There’s no direct rival that mixes modular mirror decks, fine-grained motion, and open scripting. Unlike one-off art builds or binary mirror walls, we keep the control flow consistent from a single panel to a full wall, so makers can demo on the bench and then scale up without rewriting everything. This means faster setup days and more time tweaking the look, not the hardware.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Repeatable mirror cues:** Save and replay reflection patterns that land in the same spot every time, even after teardown.
- **Cool-running motion planning:** Keep motors from bogging down or overheating so the light show stays smooth all night.
- **One-button homing:** Kick off bump-stop homing and know every mirror starts from a solid baseline.

### Collaboration Features
- **Preset sharing packs:** Swap scenes with friends so they can remix your favorite light sweeps in their own setups.
- **Quick health checks:** Glance at status readouts to spot lazy motors before inviting a crowd over.

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-panel sync:** Link extra islands when you’re ready to cover a whole wall with coordinated reflections.
- **Live play modes:** Let guests “paint” with their reflection using joysticks, sensors, or code hooks.
- **Scene sandboxing:** Test reachability and timing in software before committing to a build session.
