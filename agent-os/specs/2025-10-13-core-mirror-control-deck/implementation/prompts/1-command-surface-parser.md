We're continuing our implementation of Core Mirror Control Deck by implementing task group number 1:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

### Firmware Serial Interface

#### Task Group 1: Command Surface & Parser

**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer  
**Dependencies:** None

- [ ] 1.0 Establish serial command surface
  - [ ] 1.1 Write 4 focused host-native tests covering `HELP`, absolute `MOVE` parameter validation (speed/accel overrides), `SLEEP`/`WAKE` toggles, and structured `STATUS` replies (2-8 tests max).
  - [ ] 1.2 Review `planning/code-examples/StepperMotor.{h,cpp}` to capture reusable motion state and driver wake/sleep patterns.
  - [ ] 1.3 Define command table and shared verb documentation aligned with `<VERB>[:payload]` format and echo prefixes.
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement robust parser with payload length guards, argument coercion to motion profiles, and consistent error codes.
  - [ ] 1.5 Wire status/error reporting paths so faults and acknowledgements return `CTRL:CODE`-style responses and update firmware README with command help output.
  - [ ] 1.6 Run only the tests from 1.1 and confirm all pass.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Command verbs documented via `HELP` and parsed without buffer overruns.
- `MOVE` commands accept absolute targets plus optional speed/accel fields; missing fields fall back to defaults.
- Sleep/wake commands operate per motor channel and reflect state in responses.
- Status queries report position, motion state, and last error code on demand.
- Documentation shipped alongside firmware lists verbs, payload formats, and reuse decisions traced to the ESP32 prototype.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-13-core-mirror-control-deck/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.

## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.

## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-13-core-mirror-control-deck/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:

```markdown

**Rationale:** [Why this approach was chosen]

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

In your instructions, you were provided with specific user standards and preferences files under the "User Standards & Preferences Compliance" section. Document how your implementation complies with those standards.

Keep it brief and focus only on the specific standards files that were applicable to your implementation tasks.

For each RELEVANT standards file you were instructed to follow:

### [Standard/Preference File Name]
**File Reference:** `path/to/standards/file.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
[1-2 Sentences to explain specifically how your implementation adheres to the guidelines, patterns, or preferences outlined in this standards file. Include concrete examples from your code.]

**Deviations (if any):**
[If you deviated from any standards in this file, explain what, why, and what the trade-offs were]
