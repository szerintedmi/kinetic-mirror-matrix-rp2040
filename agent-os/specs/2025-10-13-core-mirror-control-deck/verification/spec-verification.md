# Spec Verification Report — Core Mirror Control Deck

## Basic Structural Verification

- ✅ `planning/initialization.md` contains the raw user description.
- ✅ `planning/requirements.md` records the Q&A, additional notes, and reuse pointers.
- ✅ `spec.md` exists and follows the required structure.
- ✅ `tasks.md` is present with grouped task lists.
- ✅ `implementation/` and `verification/` folders exist (empty, as expected).
- ⚠️ No assets detected in `planning/visuals/`; visual alignment is not required but was confirmed via `ls`.

## Requirements Accuracy Check

- ✅ All eight clarifying questions and answers appear verbatim.
- ✅ Additional note about position tracking, ±1200-step limits, default speed/accel, and per-command overrides is captured without embellishment.
- ✅ Requirements summary mirrors user guidance; homing details now stay within the stated constraints (defaults allowed, override via serial).
- ✅ Reuse opportunities list the ESP32 FastAccelStepper prototype paths provided by the user.
- ✅ Requirements explicitly state no visuals were supplied, aligning with the directory check.

## Specification Validation

- ✅ Goal and user stories align with the desire for serial-only RP2040 control, autosleep, and homing/status flows.
- ✅ Functional requirements cover command verbs, limit enforcement, autosleep, and eight-motor support—matching user expectations.
- ✅ Non-functional requirements emphasize PIO usage, parsing guards, and power management in line with standards.
- ✅ Reusable components section cites the ESP32 prototype and existing PlatformIO scaffold as foundations.
- ✅ Out-of-scope list reiterates exclusions (power-aware scheduling, multi-node control, host CLI) per requirements.

## Task List Validation

- ✅ Task Group 1 & 2 (api-engineer) each start with 2–8 focused tests and end by running only those suites.
- ✅ Task Group 3 (testing-engineer) writes 4–6 integration tests, adds smoke/checklist updates, and runs only feature-specific tests.
- ✅ Tasks explicitly reference reusing `planning/code-examples/StepperMotor.{h,cpp}` and documenting divergences.
- ✅ No scope creep: tasks map directly to serial parsing, motion engine, homing, autosleep, and validation workflows.
- ⚠️ Overview states “Total Tasks: 16” while the checklist enumerates 21 bullet tasks—suggest updating the count for clarity.
- ✅ No visuals exist; therefore, absence of visual references in tasks is acceptable.

## Issues Summary

### Critical Issues
None.

### Minor Issues
1. Overview task count (16) does not match the 21 actionable checklist entries; adjust to avoid confusion.

### Reusability Concerns
- None. Reuse of the ESP32 FastAccelStepper prototype is acknowledged in both tasks and spec.

## Conclusion

Specification verification **passed with a minor correction noted**. Update the task count summary for accuracy, then proceed to implementation planning.
